### Short Summary
This project implements a spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and a Naive Bayes model. The pipeline preprocesses email text and uses the model to classify messages as spam or not spam, with an evaluation on test data.

### Documentation for Spam Email Classifier Using Naive Bayes

#### Overview
This repository contains a Python implementation of a spam email classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and a Naive Bayes model. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of emails, and it predicts whether new emails are spam or not. The project includes text preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation steps.

#### Prerequisites
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed before running the code:
- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

You can install the necessary libraries using:
```bash
pip install nltk pandas scikit-learn
```

#### Code Breakdown

1. **Importing Libraries**
   ```python
   import nltk
   import pandas as pd
   from nltk.corpus import stopwords
   from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
   from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
   ```
   The required libraries for text preprocessing, model building, and evaluation are imported.

2. **Downloading NLTK Data**
   ```python
   nltk.download('punkt')
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```
   The necessary NLTK data for tokenization and stopword filtering is downloaded.

3. **Text Preprocessing Function**
   ```python
   def preprocess_text(text):
       tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
       filtered_words = [word for word in tokens if word.isalnum() and word not in stopwords.words('english')]
       return ' '.join(filtered_words)
   ```
   This function tokenizes the text, converts it to lowercase, removes stopwords, and keeps only alphanumeric tokens. The resulting cleaned text is returned as a string.

4. **Sample Text Preprocessing**
   ```python
   sample_text = "This is an example email!"
   processed_text = preprocess_text(sample_text)
   print("Processed Sample Text:", processed_text)
   ```
   A sample email is processed using the `preprocess_text` function to demonstrate text preprocessing.

5. **Loading and Preparing the Dataset**
   ```python
   data = pd.read_csv('spam.csv', encoding='latin-1')
   data = data[['v1', 'v2']]  # Assuming the columns are named 'v1' for Category and 'v2' for Message
   data.columns = ['Category', 'Message']
   data['Spam'] = data['Category'].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == 'spam' else 0)
   ```
   The dataset is loaded and prepared for modeling. The dataset is assumed to have columns for email category (`v1`) and message (`v2`). The 'Category' column is renamed, and a new binary column 'Spam' is created where spam is labeled as `1` and non-spam as `0`.

6. **Text Preprocessing for the Dataset**
   ```python
   data['Message'] = data['Message'].apply(preprocess_text)
   ```
   The `Message` column is preprocessed using the `preprocess_text` function.

7. **Splitting the Dataset**
   ```python
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data['Message'], data['Spam'], test_size=0.25, random_state=42)
   ```
   The dataset is split into training and testing sets with a 75-25 ratio.

8. **Building and Training the Model Pipeline**
   ```python
   clf = Pipeline([
       ('vectorizer', CountVectorizer()),
       ('nb', MultinomialNB())
   ])
   clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```
   A pipeline is created that first converts text into a matrix of token counts using `CountVectorizer` and then applies the `MultinomialNB` classifier. The model is trained on the training data.

9. **Making Predictions**
   ```python
   emails = [
       'Sounds great! Are you home now?',
       'Will u meet ur dream partner soon? Is ur career off 2 a flyng start? 2 find out free, txt HORO followed by ur star sign, e. g. HORO ARIES'
   ]
   predictions = clf.predict(emails)
   print("Predictions:", predictions)
   ```
   The model predicts whether a list of sample emails is spam or not.

10. **Evaluating the Model**
    ```python
    accuracy = clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    print("Accuracy on test data:", accuracy)
    ```
    The model's accuracy is calculated on the test data, providing a measure of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.

#### Conclusion
This project provides a complete pipeline for building a spam email classifier using a Naive Bayes model. The process includes text preprocessing, model training, and evaluation, offering a robust approach to identifying spam emails.

#### Future Improvements
- **Feature Engineering**: Explore different feature extraction techniques, such as TF-IDF, to potentially improve model accuracy.
- **Model Optimization**: Fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Naive Bayes model or explore other classifiers like SVM or Random Forest.
